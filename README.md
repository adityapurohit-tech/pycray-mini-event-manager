#  Mini Event Manager

A simple and modern Event Manager built for **PyCray Tech’s Full Stack Developer (Next.js) assignment**. Easily add, list, delete, and search events — all with a clean Next.js + Tailwind UI.

---

##  How to Run

1. Install dependencies:  
pnpm install

2. Start development server:  
pnpm dev

3. Open in browser:  
http://localhost:3000/events

---

## Path of the Page

- Source file:  
app/events/page.tsx

- URL route:  
/events

---

## Notes / Assumptions

- Fully client-side; no backend or API routes are used.  
- Events persist in **localStorage** across reloads.  
- State is managed with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).  
- Dark/light mode toggle is session-only (does not persist).  
- Styled with TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive design.  
- Icons provided by **react-icons** (ensure you install with `pnpm add react-icons`).
